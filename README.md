# OpenTTT
## What is OpenTTT?

OpenTTT is a suite of applications to aid in timetabling [OpenTTD](https://www.openttd.org) trains. Yes, we're serious about trains.

## You're seriousâ€½

About trains? Yes. About writing these projects? Also yes!

Besides being a good honing for my Java and (newfound) Angular skills, it's something to give back to a community I dearly love

## So, what do you got for me?

Nothing yet. The frontend is currently running at an undisclosed location (get in touch with me on the [/r/openttd](https://old.reddit.com/r/openttd) Discord if you wanna see a lot of bugs!)

As soon as a presentable version is ready, I will link it here.
